#### Senior Developer

Hi! My name's Tom and I'm a Senior Backend Developer and Tech lead.

I have mainly worked with Kotlin for the backend, using frameworks such as Spring. However, having worked for ThoughtWorks for the past six years, I have a broad experience working in stacks and languages such as Scala, TypeScript with React, Go and Ruby. I most enjoy utilising these tools in an environment that focuses on writing code according to certain sensible defaults. These include TDD, having a strong focus on robust and fast CI/CD processes, and having flexible agile ways of working.

I enjoy working in organisations that focus implementing their systems in accordance with Domain Driven Design principles, and have a particular passion for clean architecture and it's implementation in projects. Furthermore, I have helped organise and conduct event storming workshops with the aim of improving clients understanding of their own domains.

Having worked for a variety of clients and having played the role of tech lead at ThoughtWorks for nearly two years, I have helped teams and organisations shift and adjust both their technical implementation as well as their working practices in order to ensure value and quality. 

My ideal role would be as a backend kotlin developer in a place that embraces these concepts, in a communicative, open and friendly environment.


### Communication and Consultant Skills

The common thread throughout all the jobs that I've done, and for all the clients that I have worked for is the necessity for the ability to communicate.

+ As the tech lead for teams working with external clients, I have a large amount of experience working with client stakeholders who needed to understand the latest developments within the team, and how they might effect the client overall. This has often meant knowing how to have difficult or unconfortable conversations.

+ Leading teams has also meant having to give constructive feedback to other team members, which is not always a comfortable thing to do. 

+ As a mentor for several colleagues in the past who wished to upskill, communication has always been fundamental. I have always enjoyed trying to help colleagues understand new concepts, and embrace the challenge of finding new ways to impart knowledge in an easily digestable manner.

+ I have also been in positions in the past where I have been able to influence clients that I have worked for in terms of their ways of working, or implementation methods. This has often required a communicative process in order to persuade clients to try something new or different.  

+ Working directly with colleagues and team members for long hours during the course of the day, often pair programming, requires the ability to communicate clearly. Often there are occasions when one can disagree with ones colleague over implementation details. It is important to be able to communicate these disagreements in a constructive way, while remembering that at the end of the day "it's just code".
